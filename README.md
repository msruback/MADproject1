# MADproject1
Requirements
1. Create an Activity for adding new classes(used Dialog box instead)
2. Create an Activity for adding new contacts(working on now)
3. Main Activity must show all class contacts(need to look into listviews to implement)
4. Click a contact should bring up a detailed view of the contact(see above)

Extra
1. Create an Activity for editing contacts(possible, not implemented yet)
2. Add functionality to remove contacts(possible, not implemented yet)
3. Store a photo for each contact(working on now)
4. Be able to edit photo(working on now)

Plan
Main Activity shows all contacts, has two app bar buttons that allow users to add class via a dialog box, or class contacts via a new activity
Users will be able to also tap contacts(using general onclick for listview) to view an expanded view of that contact
This expanded view will allow users to delete or edit the contact with icons on the app bar.
